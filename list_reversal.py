	NOTES FOR @Trent:	Make sure to keep your program organized. Use functions, break
						functionality up, so that things are easier to deal with.
						Comment your methods. Don't just write code only in the main.
						USE GOOD VARIABLE NAMES! x is not a good variable name, as it does
						not tell me anything about what x really is, or what it represents.
						Long variables names are not a bad thing. Same thing with function
						names. Finally, Always give your methods a header, it tells the user
						the type of each thing, what the params are, and what the expected 
						return type and what that return type should be associated with :)
